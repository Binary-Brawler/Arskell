Basically hArch but without the Hacking tools and an automated setup for Haskell Development...

Seems to be working great

on startup run "firstRun" inside terminal

    1. Loads MATE config
    2. Starts DHCP if using wired connection 
    3. Updates system
    4. Using <https://get-ghcup.haskell.org> install GHCUP
